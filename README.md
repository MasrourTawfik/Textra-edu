# Textra-edu
Textra-edu processes educational documents (PDF, DOC, images) to extract text. It then uses advanced language models (GPT-3, T5) to generate summaries and annotations, enhancing understanding and learning.


**Textra-edu: A Text Processing Tool**

Textra-edu is a tool designed to extract and process text from various document formats. It's particularly useful for educational content, where extracting key information can be time-consuming.

**How it Works:**

1. **Document Upload:** Upload documents in PDF, DOC, or image formats.
2. **Text Extraction:** 
   - **OCR for Images:** For image formats, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is employed to extract text.
   - **Direct Text Extraction:** For PDF and DOC formats, text is extracted directly.
3. **Text Processing:** The extracted text is processed using advanced language models like GPT-3 or T5. This can involve:
   - **Summarization:** Condensing long texts into shorter summaries.
   - **Keyword Extraction:** Identifying the most important keywords and phrases.
   - **Question Answering:** Answering questions based on the text content.
4. **Output:** The processed text, summaries, or answers are presented to the user.

**Future Directions:**

* **Multilingual Support:** Expanding the tool to support multiple languages.
* **Advanced Summarization Techniques:** Implementing more sophisticated summarization algorithms.
* **Interactive Annotation:** Allowing users to annotate and highlight specific parts of the text.
* **Real-time Processing:** Processing documents in real-time for immediate feedback.
